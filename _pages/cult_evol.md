Cultural Evolution is a theoretical framework and an interdisciplinary endeavor that aims to understand diversity across cultural communities through the mechanisms by which information is learnt. It combines expertise from psychology, history, anthropology, cognitive science, evolutionary ecology, among other areas in building evolutionary models that explore the mechanisms by which information spreads across time and within populations.
