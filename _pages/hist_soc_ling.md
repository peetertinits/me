Historical sociolinguistics is a research area that aims to combine expertise from historical linguistics and sociolinguistics to study past or long-term language changes in considering the language use in social context. One of the biggest problems in the area is "bad data" (Labov 1992): data on the area can be sparse, badly classified and finite, that makes difference to how data analysis can unfold. One of its current principles - "informational maximalism" (Joseph & Janda 2003) - aims to collect data from as many different sources as possible to aim to study the issues in combination.
