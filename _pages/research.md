I am a PhD student in linguistics, interested in [cultural evolution](/cult-evol/), [historical sociolinguistics](/hist-soc-ling/) and empirical methods in humanities. My core research interest is in how social learning made by individuals can influence patterns on population levels. I have used various historical datasets to study this process, and am interested in more data.

My PhD project at Tallinn University is on the standardization of written Estonian in the late 19th century. I have studied the evolution of films, knowledge systems, literature through various corpora. I have worked on incorporating natural scientific expertise in humanities questions (e.g. through digital humanities, or [experimental semiotics](/exp-sem/)).

I am currently finishing up my dissertation and involved in a few other research projects. This page will be updated as these outputs are published.
