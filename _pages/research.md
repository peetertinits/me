I am a PhD student in linguistics, interested in [cultural evolution](/me/cult-evol/), [historical sociolinguistics](/me/hist-soc-ling/) and empirical methods in humanities. My core research interest is in how social learning made by individuals can influence patterns on population levels. I have used various historical datasets to study this process, and am interested in more data.

My PhD project at Tallinn University is on the standardization of written Estonian in the late 19th century. I have studied the evolution of films, knowledge systems, literature through various corpora. I have also thought more generally about how to involve natural scientific expertise in humanities questions through digital humanities, experimental methods (especially [experimental semiotics](/me/exp-sem/) or something else.



I am in final stages of my PhD study, and currently in the progress of writing up a few different research projects. I will update this page as the work is completed. There are a few publications out already, they are presented below.
