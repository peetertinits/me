Materials: Intro to Text Mining in R with Estonian Popsongs
========================================

As part of the studies in Digital Methods and Contemporary datasets we learned about using R and Tidyverse to do simple text processing, on the example of Estonian pop songs 1994-2018. The dataset is posted on [github](https://github.com/peeter-t2/EestiTop40_laulus6nad).

The materials are posted online on [github](https://github.com/peeter-t2/TM_SV_TartuFall2020). Some graphs made:
