Text mining in R and reproducible research
========================================

As part of the summer school [Digital Methods in Humanities and Social Sciences](https://digitalmethods.ut.ee/) in the University of Tartu, I gave a workshop on [Introduction to R and Tidyverse](https://github.com/peeter-t2/IntroR_DIGMET2020). The workshop aimed to give the basics of tidyverse in R and how to use it for data manipulation.

The materials are posted online on [github](https://github.com/peeter-t2/IntroR_DIGMET2020). Some graphs made:
