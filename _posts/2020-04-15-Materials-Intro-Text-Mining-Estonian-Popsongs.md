Materials: Intro to Text Mining in R with Estonian Popsongs
========================================

As part of the coursework for "Analysing large digital text collections" at the University of Tartu, I compiled an online learning guide to teach the basics of R and simple text mining on the example of Estonian pop songs 1994-2018. The dataset is posted on [github](https://github.com/peeter-t2/EestiTop40_laulus6nad).

The materials themselves are published as a [gitbook](https://peetertinits.github.io/gitbooks/tekstid_R_2020/).
