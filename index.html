<section class="page__content" itemprop="text">

<p>I am a researcher in digital humanities on a postdoctoral project at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany with a part affiliation in the University of Tartu, Estonia and Helsinki University, Finland. My postdoctoral project is on the spread of ideas seen from the lense of early modern book printing. My interests lay in <a href="/cult-evol/">cultural evolution</a>, <a href="/hist-soc-ling/">historical sociolinguistics</a> and empirical methods in humanities.
</p>

<p> My PhD thesis <a href="https://www.etera.ee/zoom/203116/view">Cultural Evolution in Language and Art</a> combined a variety of methods and data sources to investigate general patterns in the evolution of cultural systems. I have a broad interest in data-intensive projects in the Humanities and Social Sciences, and, time permitting, I am happy to collaborate. See more on published <a href="/research/">research</a> and academic <a href="/talks/">talks</a>.</p>
