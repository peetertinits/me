<section class="page__content" itemprop="text">

<p>I am a PhD student in linguistics, interested in <a href="/cult-evol/">cultural evolution</a>, <a href="/hist-soc-ling/">historical sociolinguistics</a> and empirical methods in humanities. I aim to apply digital humanities tools, particularly text mining, to study historical social change. I'm currently employed by the University of Tartu and the National Library of Estonia as a digital humanities/text mining specialist.
</p>

<p>I have a broad interest in data-intensive projects in the Humanities and Social Sciences, and, time permitting, I am happy to collaborate. My PhD thesis (in final stages) is on corpus and data based approach to mechanisms of spelling standardization for late 19th century Estonian. Recently, at the University of Tartu we have started a large-scale text mining project to track deep societal changes in recent history via newspaper texts.</p>

<p>This website is updated irregularly, drop me an e-mail for contact.</p>
